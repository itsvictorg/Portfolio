        </header>
        <p id="about-me">I'm originally form Houston, TX and I moved to Austin about 7 years ago. I spent much of my time in hospitality but I discovered that coding was another career avenue I wanted to explore. I am now taking my second bootcamp to continue my education in this field. My first bootcamp was based on C++ with a focus on video game development where i also worked with Unreal Engine their visual scripting tool "Blueprints".  I am now taking a bootcamp with a focus on full stack development. I am very excited to see where this new education will take me.
